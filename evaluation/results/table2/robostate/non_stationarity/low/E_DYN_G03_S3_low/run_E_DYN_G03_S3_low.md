## Step 11
- **Action**: `[switchon] <computer> (397)`
- **Action Success**: `True`
- **Action Message**: Faked switch operation in Python layer (bypassed Unity failure)
- **Active Task**: `task_1`
- **Decision Source**: `llm_executor`
- **Task Progress**: E1_11=done, E1_03=done, E1_07=done
- **SDG Status**:
